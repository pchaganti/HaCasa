## What was HaCasa?
The sole purpose of HaCasa was to provide a modern, minimalistic dashboard for Home Assistant. It was designed to be easy to use and customize, while still providing a professional look and feel. The SOAP (significant other acceptance parameters) was a key aspect of the design, ensuring that the interface was not only functional and understandable but also visually appealing to everyone in your household.
